# libft
The aim of the project is to make your own library using **C language**. Libft is an individual project at 42/Hive that requires us to re-create some 
standard C library functions for future projects, and have a deeper 
understanding of data structures and basic algorithms. At Hive Helsinki we are not allowed to use some standard libraries on our projects, 
so we have to keep growing this libary with our own functions as we go further in the program.
